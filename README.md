# Computational Methods in Pricing and Model Calibration (Columbia University)
This course focuses on computational methods in option and interest rate, productâ€™s pricing and model calibration. The first module will introduce different types of options in the market, followed by an in-depth discussion into numerical techniques helpful in pricing them, e.g. Fourier Transform (FT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods. We will explain models like Black-Merton-Scholes (BMS), Heston, Variance Gamma (VG), which are central to understanding stock price evolution, through case studies and Python codes. The second module introduces concepts like bid-ask prices, implied volatility, and option surfaces, followed by a demonstration of model calibration for fitting market option prices using optimization routines like brute-force search, Nelder-Mead algorithm, and BFGS algorithm. The third module introduces interest rates and the financial products built around these instruments. We will bring in fundamental concepts like forward rates, spot rates, swap rates, and the term structure of interest rates, extending it further for creating, calibrating, and analyzing LIBOR and swap curves. We will also demonstrate the pricing of bonds, swaps, and other interest rate products through Python codes. The final module focuses on real-world model calibration techniques used by practitioners to estimate interest rate processes and derive prices of different financial products. We will illustrate several regression techniques used for interest rate model calibration and end the module by covering the Vasicek and CIR model for pricing fixed income instruments.
## Financial Engineering and Risk Management Specialization
This specialization provides a broad introduction to financial engineering fundamentals. The emphasis of Introduction to Financial Engineering and Risk Management and Term-Structure and Credit Derivatives will be on the use of simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. The follow up courses, Optimization Methods in Asset Management and Advanced Topics in Derivative Pricing, will continue to develop derivatives pricing models. They will also focus on asset allocation and portfolio optimization, as well as other applications of financial engineering such as real options, commodity and energy derivatives, and algorithmic trading. Computational Methods in Pricing and Model Calibration focuses on model calibration, option pricing, and interest rate instruments. 

Below is the series of Financial Engineering and Risk Management Specialization:
1. Introduction to Financial Engineering and Risk Management
2. Term-Structure and Credit Derivatives
3. Optimization Methods in Asset Management
4. Advanced Topics in Derivative Pricing
5. Computational Methods in Pricing and Model Calibration 

The overarching topics of the specialization include: 
1. Derivative pricing (stochastic models, binomial tree, term structure)
2. Asset allocation (CAPM, mean-variance analysis)
3. Other topics (algorithmic trading; commodity and energy market; credit derivatives)
4. Interview with Prof. Emanuel Derman

The specialization will also draw from numerous case studies and industry practices, so that you'll also learn how to apply FE models to solve problems and apply it in the real world.
